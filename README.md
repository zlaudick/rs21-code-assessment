Coding Assessment for RS21 application process

My strategy for this project was to decide what data to visualize, then decide how to visualize it, and finally, learn how to visualize it. After looking through the provided data I decided to focus on the transportation data and find out what percentage of people are using environmentally friendly transportation methods for their daily commute. I defined walking, biking, carpooling, and public transportation as environmentally friendly, or "green", transportation methods. <br>
<br>
To visualize the data I used Mapbox and D3. I had never used Mapbox before so I turned to Skyler Rexroad (@skylarity) for help. I referenced his recent Mapbox project along with the Mapbox documentation to learn how to create the map with color shading to show the percentage of people using "green" transportation.

<br>
The most interesting part of this project was learning to use Mapbox. I've never used a geospatial library before so it was a fun learning experience.

There are two ways I would improve this project. The first would be to get the data for median income. I would like to see if people are mainly using these "green" transportation methods to save money versus using them to reduce carbon footprint. The second would be to compare the data with other counties/cities to see how bernalillo county stacks up. Then compare things like median income and access to public transportation to find out why other counties/cities are using "green" transportation more or less.
